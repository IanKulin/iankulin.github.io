# ISS Location

ISS Location is a simple web page to demonstrate fetching from an API. It polls the [Open Notify](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/) API every five seconds.

This was an exercise from section 265 of the ZTM [Complete Web Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course on Udemy.
